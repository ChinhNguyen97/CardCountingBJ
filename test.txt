#Test runs

Run 1:
	App: PokerStar
	Description: Estimated 8 decks, might be less. Didn't play. Deck penetration 50-55% (Bad): ~4/8 decks. 
	Notes: Hard to keep up with dealers dealing speed. Need to used side numpad for this.
	True count deviation: -0.7% to +1.6%.
	Analysis: Focus was on accurate count. Didn't keep track of players win/loses.

Run 2:
	App: Roobet
	Description: 8 decks, 51% penetration. Didnt play.
	Notes: Full table most of the time. Used numpad for improved speed. Barely keept up. 
	True count deviation: -1.7% to +3.3%.
	Analysis: 
		True count and Illustrous 18 helped in deciding 1 winning hand that basic strategy would act differently 
		Mostly focused on keeping up with dealing.  
		Counting gives slightly more info on when to raise your bets. For future, need to used bet spreads to maximize winnings.
